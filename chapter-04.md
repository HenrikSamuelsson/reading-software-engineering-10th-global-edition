# Exercises Chapter 4

## Exercise 4.1

Identify and briefly describe four types of requirements that may be defined for a computer based system.

## Solution 4.1

1. User requirements

    These requirements are the statements in a natural language and possibly diagrams of the services the system provides and its operational constraints

2. System requirements

    A structured and detailed document compared to the user requirements describing the system functions, services and operational constraints

3. Functional requirements

    Statements of services that the system should provide, how the system should react to particular inputs and how the system should behave in particular situations

4. Non-functional requirements

    Constraints on the services or functions offered by the system such as timing constraints, constraints on the development process, standards, security, etc
