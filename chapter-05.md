## Exercise 5.1

Scope creep can be defined as a continuous increase in the scope of a project that can significantly increase project cost. Explain how a proper model of the system context can help prevent scope creeps.

## Solution 5.1

A model of the system can be completed early in the development phase, because it is simpler, and faster, to implement a model than the complete system. The customer of the project, or other suitable stakeholder, can then review and approve the model as part of the agreement of what to be developed. Scope creep can later on be prevented by pointing back at the initial model which now serves as a reminder about what the initial agreement was. If a functionality originally was not in the model it was also not part of the agreement.
