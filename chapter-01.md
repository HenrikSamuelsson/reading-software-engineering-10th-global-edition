# Exercises Chapter 1

## Exercise 1.1

Explain why professional software that is developed for a customer is not simply the programs that have been developed and delivered.

## Solution 1.1

Professional software can besides the program delivered include objects such as user manuals, customer specific configuration files, documentation of design, test results, list of known deviations from the customer requirements.

There can also be a need to produce material related to legislation's that must be followed such as the General Data Protection Regulation.

## Exercise 1.2

What is the most important difference between generic software product development and custom
software development? What might this mean in practice for users of generic software products?  

## Solution 1.2

A generic software is developed for a wider range of customers than a custom software. A custom software will in the extreme case be developed to be used by a single customer even though it would possibly have several users since the customer would typically be a company.

The end user is known ahead of starting the development in a custom product development project and will possibly be part of the development process, providing input and request for changes as the work proceeds. The exact end users are not known in generic software development meaning that the strategy used for collecting input and requirements will have to be handled in some other way.

Users of generic software products will typically have little influence on the development and the end functionality since the pool of users is typically large and only a small amount of users are realistically deeply involved in the development. The fit between the users needs and the functionality of the software will hence not be as good as it could be. The benefit is that the users share the cost of the development and the price comes down greatly per user.
